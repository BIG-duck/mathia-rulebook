# mathia rulebook
Welcome to the rulebook for Mathia!

To get started, `git clone` the repo, and make sure you have `ruby (==2.6)` and `gem` installed. Ruby 2.7 (latest) **will not work**. Then, `bundle install`, `bundle exec jekyll serve` and, finally, hop over to `localhost:4000` on your favourite web browser to run it locally!
