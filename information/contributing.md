Hey! Good to hear that you want to help out.

This wiki is hosted on GitHub! What you're reading right now has been generated by a site generator called _Jekyll_. How it works isn't really important, but you have to understand a few things before you can contribute:


### Contributing to the Documentation
Due to the nature of Git, you can both make confirmed changes and also proposals (which are to be discussed).

Your changes must be in a specific format in order to make everything work. Let's say you want to create a new role. There is a template, in [New Role Template]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link information/new-role-template.md %}). Follow it religiously. Stick to the guidelines and the rules. If the template says to put a space, put a space. The system can be a little confusing for non-developers, so here's a step-by-step tutorial!

First, head over to where the code is hosted, on [GitHub](https://github.com/denosawr/mathia-rulebook). The files in this wiki are typed using Markdown, which is a word preprocessor like LaTeX. Unlike Microsoft Word, you don't `Cmd+B` in order to type bold! You use `**bold**`. The formatting is almost identical to the formatting supported by Discord. A quick search online for "Github Flavoured Markdown" should explain how to use Markdown, if you're still unsure.

If you want to edit an existing page, you can scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Edit on GitHub". If you want to add a new role, go to the `roles` folder on the GitHub repo, and create a new file with the name of the role you wish to add.

There is an excellent tutorial on how to edit files and submit a pull request [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository). Check it out for an explanation of how to create a pull request.

Always ensure that your changes, be it suggestions, or clarifications to the existing rules, are pointed to the `base:master` branch when you submit a Pull Request.

Now, it's up to the Game Masters to discuss or approve your changes. If you have proposed a suggestion, it will probably be discussed in the server.

### Anything else?
Yes! GitHub will spam your email _hard_. Make sure that you're not watching the `denosawr/mathia-rulebook` repo; if you are, click the "Unwatch" button to not... be spammed to hell. Also, disable email notifications at [https://github.com/settings/notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications): uncheck

### Contributing to the Code
This repository follows the Github Flow form. That means that if you have a feature, create a new descriptive branch in your own fork and submit a pull request to `base:master`. As `base:master` must always be deployable, ensure your code builds before submitting a PR; the repo also has a custom CI build action to verify this. Do not PR to `base:documentation` if you do not have documentation proposals or changes.
