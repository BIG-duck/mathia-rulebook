Hi there! We're a group of people who play Mafia on the Internet, over Discord. This rulebook is a comprehensive collection of the (somewhat convoluted) rules that we use.

[You can join our Discord](https://discord.gg/cwfdjE) to play with us!

Website was made by `@denosawr#8290` and is hosted on GitHub Pages through Jekyll. The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/denosawr/mathia-rulebook). The ruleset has been made with the love of all the players on the server, though!

We hope you can join us sometime soon :)
