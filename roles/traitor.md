title: Traitor
layout: role
alignment: mafia
enabled: yes
description: a mafia member that does not know and cannot communicate with his mafia buddies, and has no night abilities to help
---

The Traitor, alternatively called the Minion, is not told the names of his mafia members, has no night-time abilities, but bears the knowledge that he is aligned with the mafia. The Traitor is in a separate text channel from the rest of the mafia, and thus cannot communicate nor see the names of their team members. The Traitor is unknown by the rest of the mafia members. Note that there are no restrictions on the Traitor and other mafia members communicating through in-game whispers if they were to discover each other's identities.

The Traitor does not have much to his name, and can therefore take more risks to sabotage and confuse the townsfolk.

In a special 'Gang Mafia' game, where 2 mafia teams coexist, one Traitor is in play, and can win with either mafia team.

### Interactions
The Traitor has no interactions.
