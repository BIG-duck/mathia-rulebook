Every night, the Tracker can target a player to learn about the target of their actions, but not their actions.

Every night, the Mafia chooses one member will physically perform the kill. If the Tracker tracks an alternative Mafia player, nothing will happen.

There are no restrictions on who the Tracker can target.
