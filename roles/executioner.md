At the start of the game, a random player is chosen as the Executioner's _target_. The Executioner's win condition is to successfully lynch their target. When this happens, the identity of the Executioner is revealed. It is then publicly announced that they have won, and they are removed from the game.

If the target dies in any way other than being lynched, the Executioner (if alive) becomes a Jester. 

### Interactions
